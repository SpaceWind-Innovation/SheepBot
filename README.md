# 🐑 Sheep Bot  

**Upload any document → Ask anything → Get AI-powered answers**  

Sheep Bot is an intelligent chatbot that allows you to upload documents (PDF, Word, or text) and then ask questions about them.  
It uses AI to understand the content and give you accurate, conversational replies – just like talking to a human who has read the document.  

---

## 📖 Overview
Instead of manually searching through long documents, Sheep Bot makes the process effortless.  
You simply upload your file, and the bot can extract, process, and understand the text. Then you can ask **any question** related to the document, and it will reply with context-aware answers.
